# Info on new vue branch, (well it's not new now)

* This is a GitHub branch for sharing code and potentially for deployment 
* It is structured as a firebase hosting filesystem and vue app development environment so that we are able to test our code locally by using `npm run serve` or `npm run build` -> `firebase serve`
* Everything that you would need to edit would be in `/src`
