#Info on new summer reorganised branch

* This is simply a GitHub branch for sharing code.
* It is structured as a firebase hosting filesystem so that we are able to test our code locally by using `firebase serve`
* Other than that, you will find folders in src explaining what code there needs to be.
* Usually this will be 2 or more files, including a .html frontend that calls a .js backend
* At the end, we will paste our code into squarespace, and let it run from there.
* If a page only has static text content, or links (e.g. home page), then it may be fine to use squarespace's in built html components. However, in most of our code we require a lot of javascript. Note that authentication may mess up squarespace's features
