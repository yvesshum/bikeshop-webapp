# Profile Lookup
**aim**: To allow youth to lookup their profiles (or other youth's profiles), seeing basic information about their profiles

**Specifications**: 
* We don't want Youth to be able to look at each other's private information, such as phone numbers and addresses.
* This page is mainly for youth to lookup things like `Current Hours`, `Pending Hours`, `First Name`, `Last Name`, `Youth ID`, `Order Log`, `YWork Log`, `Apron Level`,  `Completed Skills`, `Active Periods`
* Profile lookup should always begin with a search bar, while not displaying anyone's info yet. Once the've searched and selected a user than the info pops up.
